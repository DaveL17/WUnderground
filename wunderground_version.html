Version: 1.0.04
EmailSubject: Wunderground Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Wunderground Plugin you are using has been updated.

WUnderground Plugin v1.0.04 is now available.

- Changes behavior to only update device states when latest downloaded data is newer than previous data.
- Fixes bug in the Write Weather Data to File routine where the plugin would write only the date/time.
- Fixes bug in the Write Weather Data to FIle routine where the plugin would only write to Indigo 6 log folder. Now the plugin tries the Indigo 7 log folder and falls back to Indigo 6 if needed.
- Ups the amount of time that the plugin waits for a response from Weather Underground from 15 seconds to 30 seconds (per weather location).
- Logging refinements.
