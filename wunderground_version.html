Version: 6.0.04
EmailSubject: Wunderground Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Wunderground Plugin you are using has been updated.

A WUnderground Plugin update is now available.

*** Note: *********************************************************************
The WUnderground Plugin is being bumped to version 6. This is to indicate that
it is compatible with Indigo 6 (v1.1.0 of the Indigo API to be precise).
WUnderground v6.0.1 will be the last version to receive any new features. Don't
Panic! Should any remaining bugs appear in WUnderground 6, I will do my best to
fix them.

The next version of the WUnderground plugin will be named WUnderground 7 and
will be bumped to at least v2.0.0 of the Indigo API. All new features from this
point forward will be targeted to version 7. WUnderground 7 will not be
compatible with Indigo 6.
*******************************************************************************

v6.0.04
- Adds additional error handling when Weather Underground sends a data value
  that is not the of proper Type (i.e., list or dict instead of an expected
  string).


As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
