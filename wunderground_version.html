Version: 6.0.1
EmailSubject: Wunderground Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Wunderground Plugin you are using has been updated.

A WUnderground Plugin update is now available.

*** Note: *********************************************************************
The WUnderground Plugin is being bumped to version 6. This is to indicate that
it is compatible with Indigo 6 (v1.1.0 of the Indigo API to be precise). This
release (WUnderground v6.0.1) will be the last version to receive any new
features. Don't Panic! Should any remaining bugs appear in WUnderground 6, I
will do my best to fix them.

The next version of the WUnderground plugin will be named WUnderground 7 and
will be bumped to at least v2.0.0 of the Indigo API. All new features from this
point forward will be targeted to version 7. WUnderground 7 will not be
compatible with Indigo 6.
*******************************************************************************
