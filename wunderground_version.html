Version: 1.1.3
EmailSubject: Wunderground Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The Wunderground Plugin you are using has been updated.

WUnderground Plugin v1.1.3 is now available.

v1.1.3
- Adds new feature to WU Radar devices to populate lat/long from the Indigo
  server.
- Fixes bug in setting barometric 'pressureIcon' value for metric (M) and
  Mixed SI Wind (MS) weather devices. Harmonizes setting of icon value across
  all units types.
- Fixes bug in setting of weather device 'historyDate' value where the value
  was being set more than once when history data was not available. Now will
  be set to 'Not available' instead of '--'.
- Code refinements.

v1.1.2
- Fixes bug in setting neighborhood state where neighborhood was always set to
  the last neighborhood in the for loop.

v1.1.1
- Adds new state to Weather devices 'neighborhood' which is the neighborhood
  name of the current weather location. If neighborhood is not supported, the
  plugin will return 'Location not supported.'
- Adds new state to Weather devices 'windDIRlong' which is the verbose wind
  direction: 'north', 'north northwest', etc.
- Adds new state to 10 day Weather Forecast devices 'dxx_windDirLong' which
  is the verbose wind direction:  'north', 'north northwest', etc.
- Adds new state to 24 hour Weather Forecast devices 'hxx_windDirLong' which
  is the verbose wind direction:  'north', 'north northwest', etc.
- Fixes bug in windDIR (and associated wind states) where only the cardinal
  directions were converted to long strings - 'N' --> 'North', 'NE' --> 'NE'.
  Now all wind short strings use abbreviated wind dirs 'N' --> 'N'.
- Fixes bug in setting of animation delays for WUnderground Radar devices (the
  delay was being set to an empty string by default--which is not a valid
  option.)
