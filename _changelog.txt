WUnderground Plugin - Developed by: DaveL17

v1.0.11
- Stylistic changes to Indigo Plugin Update Checker module.
- Attempts to increase robustness when WUnderground stations are offline.
- Improves device icon state handling when communication with device is started
  or stopped via the Indigo UI or the plugin menu option.
- Improves code used to dump weather data to the Indigo Logs folder.
- Fixes minor bug in debug logging where the logging of error message and line
  number were reversed.
- Reduces information saved to debug log (unless debugging set to high).

v1.0.10
- Fixes bug in implementation of yesterday API.

v1.0.09
- Migrates history data collection from the History API element to the Yesterday
  API element.
- Weather Device: renames "History - [element]" labels as "Yesterday - "[element]"
  for triggers, control pages, etc.  (Date, High, Low, Precip)
- More granular parsing of forecast data to increase resiliency for WU API
  errors.
- Reduces instances of potential Unicode errors when writing weather data to
  file from the plugin menu.

v1.0.08
- Updates support URL for triggers.
- Adds additional information to device configuration validation errors.
- Refactors forecast email failures to push next attempt to the following day
  instead of the next plugin cycle.

v1.0.07
- Adds new device states to 10 day and Hourly Forecast devices:
  - windDegrees (for charting and control page heuristics)
  - windSpeedIcon (for control page heuristics)
- Standardizes device configuration menus for display units. (Note: each device
  may not support all possible units. For example, the Ten Day Forecast device
  supports data for snow, but the Weather device does not.)
- Improves control labels for detailed forecast titles (weather devices).
- Deprecates functionalHourlyIconName method which is no longer needed with
  version 11 of the WUnderground API.
- Fixes bug in UV data correction (used only when WU sends bad data).
- Fixes bug in refresh weather cycle to handle legacy satellite image
  downloader device names.
- Code refinements.

v1.0.06
- New trigger to report when weather locations appear to be offline (trigger
  on current observation or current temperature.
- New trigger to report when a weather location has at least one active severe
  weather alert.
- New device state with date and time of most current observation (24hr clock).
- Repair UV values when negative (force zero) and decimal (force integer)
- Modifies behavior for instances where nonsense value provided. (WU will send
  -99, -999, -9999 or "None" in instances where there is a missing value.) The
  plugin now attempts to convert these types of values consistently to -99.0 for
  numeric values and "--" for UI and string values.
- Better error trapping when WU does not provide expected forecast data in the
  API return.
- Moves support URL to Github.
- Code refinements.

v1.0.05
- Moves project to GitHub and increments version number.

v1.0.04
- Fixes bug in the Write Weather Data to File routine where the plugin would
  write only the date/time.
- Fixes bug in the Write Weather Data to FIle routine where the plugin would
  only write to Indigo 6 log folder.  Now the plugin tries the Indigo 7 log
  folder and falls back to Indigo 6 only if needed.
- Ups the amount of time that the plugin waits for a response from Weather
  Underground from 15 seconds to 30 seconds (per weather location).
- Logging refinements.

v1.0.03
- New plugin setting to ignore updates when weather data are estimated.
- Implements alternative version of API that includes more stable data
  structure (hopefully) and native day/night icon names.

v1.0.02

- Minor logging updates.

v1.0.01
- New! Adds solar radiation to Weather Device type (units: W/^2).

  incorrectly (improves upon change in v0.9.38).
- Minor changes to debug logging.

v0.9.43
- Fixes a bug that shows up when WUnderground does not send history data for a
  weather location.

  plugin preferences file (i.e., call count, email sent, etc.)
- Converts most string substitution operations to .format() method to make way
  for future enhancements.

v0.9.38
- Reinstates menu items that were mistakenly deleted in prior update.
- Better accounts for legacy device types for forecast email settings (where
  setting was saved as a string instead of a boolean.)

v0.9.37

- Fixes bug in setting for 'windGustIcon' value (broken custom image
  heuristics.)

v0.9.36

- Adds plugin setting to control the decimal precision of wind values.
- Fixes bug in setting for MPS devices where setting was sometimes over-ridden
  as KPH.

- Refinements to plugin sleep routines.
- Refinements to device updates to ensure that device instances
  aren't reloaded unnecessarily.

v0.9.32
- Adds Weather Device State for last observation (epoch.)
- Fixes bug in long wind string where wind gust was reported using
  wind gust icon data (wrong decimal point placement.)

  (estimated conditions = True).
- Fixes bug for email forecast when weather station in not online
  (estimated conditions = True).
- More robust error logging.

v0.9.31
